# ReactRouterBasics  

In this repository I went over the basics of React Router.  
I learned how to:  
- Set up routes with `createBrowserRouter` and `RouterProvider`  
- Use nested routes with a `Root` layout and `<Outlet />`  
- Handle navigation using `<Link>`, `<NavLink>`, and `useNavigate`  
- Work with dynamic routes using `useParams` (e.g., `/products/:productId`)  
- Add an `Error` page with `errorElement` for invalid paths  

This small project demonstrates how to build a simple app with a Home page, Products list, Product detail page, and navigation.
